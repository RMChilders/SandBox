# Repository Setup Instructions

## Setting up "Upgraded-PLInvBatch" Repository

Follow these steps to create and populate your repository with the upgraded C# PLInvBatch application:

### Option 1: GitHub Repository Setup

1. **Create Repository on GitHub:**
   - Go to https://github.com/new
   - Repository name: `Upgraded-PLInvBatch`
   - Description: `PLInvBatch application upgraded from VB6 to C# .NET 8.0`
   - Set to Private (recommended for business applications)
   - Initialize with README: **No** (we already have one)
   - Add .gitignore: **No** (we already have one)
   - Add license: Choose appropriate license if needed

2. **Initialize Local Git Repository:**
   ```bash
   # Navigate to your project directory
   cd /path/to/your/PLInvBatch/project
   
   # Initialize git repository
   git init
   
   # Add all C# project files
   git add .
   
   # Create initial commit
   git commit -m "Initial commit: VB6 to C# migration complete
   
   - Migrated PLInvBatch from Visual Basic 6.0 to C# .NET 8.0
   - Preserved all original functionality and processing modes
   - Enhanced error handling and logging
   - Added comprehensive documentation
   - Maintained COM interop with PLInvBus.dll"
   
   # Add remote repository
   git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/Upgraded-PLInvBatch.git
   
   # Push to GitHub
   git branch -M main
   git push -u origin main
   ```

### Option 2: Azure DevOps Repository Setup

1. **Create Repository in Azure DevOps:**
   - Go to your Azure DevOps organization
   - Create new project: `Upgraded-PLInvBatch`
   - Initialize with Git repository

2. **Clone and Push:**
   ```bash
   # Clone empty repository
   git clone https://YOUR_ORG@dev.azure.com/YOUR_ORG/Upgraded-PLInvBatch/_git/Upgraded-PLInvBatch
   
   # Copy all project files to cloned directory
   # Then commit and push
   git add .
   git commit -m "Initial commit: VB6 to C# migration complete"
   git push origin main
   ```

### Option 3: GitLab Repository Setup

1. **Create Repository on GitLab:**
   - Go to https://gitlab.com/projects/new
   - Project name: `Upgraded-PLInvBatch`
   - Set visibility level as appropriate
   - Don't initialize with README

2. **Push Code:**
   ```bash
   git init
   git remote add origin https://gitlab.com/YOUR_USERNAME/Upgraded-PLInvBatch.git
   git add .
   git commit -m "Initial commit: VB6 to C# migration complete"
   git push -u origin main
   ```

## Repository Structure

Your repository will contain:

```
Upgraded-PLInvBatch/
├── .gitignore                 # Git ignore file for .NET projects
├── README.md                  # Comprehensive project documentation
├── DEPLOYMENT.md              # Deployment guide and checklist
├── REPOSITORY_SETUP.md        # This file
├── PLInvBatch.csproj         # .NET 8.0 project file
├── Program.cs                # Application entry point
├── MainForm.cs               # Main form logic
├── MainForm.Designer.cs      # Form designer code
├── ApplicationEventLog.cs    # Enhanced logging system
├── IniFileHelper.cs          # INI file utilities
├── PLInvDB.ini.sample        # Sample configuration file
└── build.bat                 # Windows build script
```

## Repository Tags and Releases

Consider creating tags for important milestones:

```bash
# Tag the initial migration
git tag -a v1.0.0 -m "Initial VB6 to C# migration complete"

# Tag when deployed to production
git tag -a v1.0.1 -m "Production deployment ready"

# Push tags
git push origin --tags
```

## Branch Strategy Recommendations

### For Small Team:
- `main` - Production-ready code
- `develop` - Integration branch for new features
- `feature/*` - Individual feature branches

### For Single Developer:
- `main` - Stable code
- `dev` - Development work

## Repository Settings

### Recommended Settings:
1. **Branch Protection:**
   - Protect `main` branch
   - Require pull request reviews
   - Require status checks to pass

2. **Issue Templates:**
   - Bug report template
   - Feature request template
   - Deployment issue template

3. **Security:**
   - Enable vulnerability alerts
   - Enable automated security updates
   - Scan for secrets in commits

## Continuous Integration Setup

### GitHub Actions (`.github/workflows/build.yml`):
```yaml
name: Build and Test

on:
  push:
    branches: [ main, develop ]
  pull_request:
    branches: [ main ]

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: windows-latest
    
    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v3
    
    - name: Setup .NET
      uses: actions/setup-dotnet@v3
      with:
        dotnet-version: 8.0.x
        
    - name: Restore dependencies
      run: dotnet restore
      
    - name: Build
      run: dotnet build --no-restore --configuration Release
      
    - name: Test
      run: dotnet test --no-build --verbosity normal
```

## Documentation Maintenance

Keep these files updated:
- `README.md` - Project overview and features
- `DEPLOYMENT.md` - Deployment procedures
- `CHANGELOG.md` - Version history and changes
- Code comments and XML documentation

## Backup Strategy

### Repository Backup:
1. Regular commits to remote repository
2. Multiple remote repositories (GitHub + Azure DevOps)
3. Local backups of critical configuration files

### Code Backup:
1. Tag stable versions
2. Export releases as ZIP files
3. Document deployment packages

## Team Access

### Role Assignments:
- **Admin:** Full repository access, settings management
- **Maintainer:** Code review, merge permissions
- **Developer:** Read/write access to feature branches
- **Reporter:** Read access, issue creation

## Migration History

Document the migration process:
1. Original VB6 codebase analysis
2. Architecture decisions made during migration
3. Testing results and performance comparisons
4. Deployment lessons learned

This helps future developers understand the evolution of the codebase.

## Next Steps After Repository Setup

1. **Set up development environment:**
   - Clone repository to development machines
   - Install .NET 8.0 SDK
   - Configure Visual Studio/VS Code

2. **Set up CI/CD pipeline:**
   - Automated builds on commit
   - Automated testing (when tests are added)
   - Deployment automation

3. **Team onboarding:**
   - Share repository access
   - Provide development setup guide
   - Schedule code review sessions

4. **Production preparation:**
   - Set up production deployment pipeline
   - Configure monitoring and alerts
   - Plan rollback procedures
